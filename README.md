## My process
    I started with a mobile-first approach. I then went on to wrap the qr code component that were already wrapped
    <div> tag with another <div> tag.
    This was so that I could properly center the those two with the white background relative to the body.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
